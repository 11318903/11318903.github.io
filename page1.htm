<h1 style="font-family:courier;" id="hobbyDef"><small>WHAT IS HOBBY? &#129320;</small></h1>
<p style="font-family:courier;">A hobby is considered to be a regular activity that is done for enjoyment, typically during one's leisure time, not professionally and not for pay. 
Hobbies include collecting themed items and objects, engaging in creative and artistic pursuits, playing sports, or pursuing other amusements. 
Participation in hobbies encourages acquiring substantial skills and knowledge in that area. 
A list of hobbies changes with renewed interests and developing fashions, making it diverse and lengthy.<br><br> 
Hobbies tend to follow trends in society, for example stamp collecting was popular during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as postal systems were the main means of communication, while video games are more popular nowadays following technological advances. 
The advancing production and technology of the nineteenth century provided workers with more availability in leisure time to engage in hobbies. 
Because of this, the efforts of people investing in hobbies has increased with time.<br>

<h1 style="font-family:courier;" id="reason"><small>WHY DO WE NEED A HOBBY? &#128533;</small></h1>
<p style="font-family:courier;">Hobbies give you an opportunity to enhance your life. 
Hobbies allow you to destress yourself while remaining mentally productive.

Hello again! For everyone's knowledge, everyone must have their own hobby, so do I. 
I am not only have one hobby but many, for example, I like to make sweets like cakes, biscuits and I also like to exercise, play with cats and so on.<br>
But for this page I will tell you my hobby that I do most often is the hobby of reading. <br><br>

I really like reading, and this hobby of reading is not from the beginning, but it comes from my own family. 
But, I only like to read non-fiction stories, history like that and not fiction books like study books.
I really like to imagine things that do not make sense that is why I often dream no matter where in the classroom, playground and at home.
<br>
I will show you the collection of novel books that I have on the next page which is the second page and the 
third page where I show videos and pictures as well as my favorite novels.
The novels listed are not all because there are half of them I have sold and the rest are in the old house.

Please, please, please go through to all of the website page and don't forget to fill in the form in the last page thank you for your support!
